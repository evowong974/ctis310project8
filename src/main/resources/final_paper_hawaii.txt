Westernizing the Pacific Paradise: A Historical Perspective on how the Legacy of Imperialism and Colonialism has Molded the Daily Lives of Native Hawaiians in the 21st Century.
“I have been honest and have not observed any dishonesty.”

	Hawai'i, also referred to as Ka Pae Aina by its Natives, the Kanaka Maoli, is an archipelago of 137 islands stretching across the southeast and northwest Pacific Ocean (1108, 2022). While some may consider the island a romantic paradise vacation destination with its welcoming and enticing lavished resorts, pristine beaches, and majestic vistas, it is the ancestral home of the Kanaka Maoli. However, they can barely afford to live there. The problem is the legacy of imperialism. This Western ideology has historically imposed some form of marginalization, exploitation, discrimination, infliction of Western diseases, land/resource seizures, and sovereignty of the Natives since 1778. 
	In the 21st Century, the legacy of imperialism is relevant and vital as it is a reminder that its effect is deeply rooted in the globalizing world. The results are evident by the war between Ukraine and Russia, tensions between China and the United States over Taiwan’s sovereignty, and the death, devastation, and displacement of families it has caused throughout history. So, we must be inclusive, respectful, and sensitive of others everywhere we go, especially when we visit Hawai’i, as what we say or do has an impact on others as the people are still struggling to cope with the psychological traumas of colonialism, such as poverty, lack of education, homelessness, addiction, and health problems. However, despite this, the people are working with non-natives to help revive the Kanaka Maoli culture and identity through cultural education, stories, songs, petitions against using sacred lands, and the sovereignty movement. Consequently, I argue that the legacy of imperialism has traumatically shaped the daily lives of the Kanaka Maoli, as evident through the historic change in their culture and identity before and after U.S. colonization to the 21st Century. 
	Pre-colonization, the Kanaka Maoli were originally Polynesians who traveled by canoe from the Marquesas Islands and populated Hawai'i around 400 C.E. (Smithsonian.com, 2007). These “people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient, subsistent social system based on communal land tenure with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion” (UNITED STATES PUBLIC LAW 103-150, 1993). Significantly, the people were governed culturally and socially by the Kapu (sacred laws) system, which were strict regulations and penalties governing politics, religious worship, sex, landholding, the cultivation and eating of food, and even play to help protect the people (O’Connell, 2008). Moreover, there were four major components that demarcated pre-haole (pre-foreigner) Hawaiian culture and identity. For instance, the high chiefs (ali‘i nui)… ruled because… it was believed that …their wisdom and spiritual power (mana) kept them in the right relationship with people (pono) to nature, the spirit consciousness or ancestral spirits (akua), and the observed kapu (sacred laws) (O’Connell, 2018, p. 7). However, the Kanaka Maoli’s culture and identity remained this way until the arrival of Europeans. 	Significantly, the appearance of the English naval explorer Captain James Cook on the Island of Maui in 1778-1779 forever changed the lives of the Natives (Cook, p. 74). The Kanaka Maoli believed he was a god and had great mana. Cook even named the islands Sandwich Islands after his benefactor Earl of Sandwich. However, he exposed the Natives to the consequences and greed of imperialism by exploiting the people through the sandalwood trade, using the island resources and native people to restock ship supplies, and women for sex until he was slain for his mana when he returned to fix a broken mast because the Hawaiians believed that he had broken a sacred spell (Cook, 1996, p. 74). Pertinently, the encounter with Cook and his men brought Gonorrhea together with syphilis, Prostitution, falsifying himself as god and worshipped, Fleas and mosquitoes, epidemic diseases, health issues, alien plant life, religious change mixed with pagan religions, foreign medical practice, and new laws (O’Connell, 2008, p. 8; Silva, 2004, pp. 22-23). For instance, King Kamehameha I had a European bed, knives, forks, and plates… and even instructed servants to cook in the English style due to the belief that food possessed and transmitted spiritual qualities, and the British helped him unify the islands, thereby cultivating a Hawaiian dynastic affection for Britain (Cook, 2018, p. 74).
	Another example is the eradication of the Kapu system in November 1819 by King Kamehameha II as a political strategy (Diamond, 2004; Kuykendall, 1938, Vol. 1, pp. 65- 70; Kamakau, 1961, pp. 2 19-228). However, the Hawaiian cultural system remained intact as some people secretly continued practicing kapus. At the same time, some were happy that they were no longer restricted by the sacred laws but kept the ambiance of mana, pono, and akua (O’Connell, 2008, p. 6). Therefore, the brief encounter with the Europeans and exposure to their imperialist ideologies was the beginning of the shaping of the lives of Natives as it began changing their culture and identity.
	Then, from 1820, the lives of the Kanaka Maoli continued to spiral down as their culture and identity were diminished by American imperialism. At first, some of the Natives favored the adaptation of Western ideologies and the English language as they were fascinated with Christian sermons and empowerment from combining Western with Native practices to shape it to their advantage politically and economically (Cook, p. 76-79). For instance, beginning in 1820, Hawai'i sparked the interests of the United States as Protestant missionaries came to convert them. Then, the capitalists came for economic prosperity in whaling, pineapple plantations, and sugar industries and contracted workers from Japan, China, and Portugal, populating Hawai'i with diverse cultures. Then, the United States military wanted Pearl Harbor to strengthen naval power in the Pacific. These conditions eventually compelled the United States to annex Hawai’i illegally in 1898. Lastly, Hawai'i became a desirable tourist destination for vacationers. By this time, the Native population had further declined due to diseases from the Americans, capitalists, and foreign workers. For instance, they were plagued with measles, typhoid, whooping cough, smallpox, leprosy, venereal disease, and tuberculosis, and pathogenic outbreaks of dysentery, influenza, common cold,… as they refused any Western medicines to help them alleviate their symptoms, and they also suffered psychological conditioned responses to alcoholism, abortion, and infanticide from the trauma of colonialism (Cook, p. 81-82). Subsequently, the legacy of American imperialism continues to diminish their culture, identity, human rights, lands, socioeconomics, and sovereignty, almost destroying their entire civilization. 
	Then starting in the 1970s, the prolonged dispositions of imperialism and colonialism ignited a sense of nationalism and movement for self-determination and sovereignty amongst the Natives and non-natives. The Natives struggled to find their voice and regain their culture and identity while coping with colonialism's traumas, such as poverty, lack of education, homelessness, addiction, and health problems. Moreover, the cultural and identity loss from the trauma of colonization has been historically distressing for the Natives physically, socially, and psychologically, especially among the males (Sinclair et al., 2019). The reason is the Native males were culturally protectors and hegemonically masculine as their social norms encouraged them to put their health as a low priority. This perspective has affected and shaped their daily lives in how they eat, exercise, do leisurely, socially behave, and make lifestyle choices. For instance, according to medical research on Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) men’s health comprised of eight focus groups with 89 NHPI men (50% Samoan, 20% Native Hawaiian, 30% Marshallese), and the mean age of participants was 39 years, 43% reported some college or college graduate, 64% were currently married, and 63% were working full time conducted in 2017 reveals that Historical trauma from colonization is one of the factors that influence healthy eating, physical activity, and weight, to elicit recommendations for lifestyle interventions,… due to their masculine characteristics and values necessary to NHPI men (Sinclair et al., 2019).
Moreover, the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale discovered that ninety percent of men scored 20 or higher on the K10 scale, indicating mild to severe psychological distress (Sinclair et al., 2019) This stress stems from NHPI men having to take on new roles that conformed to American and Judeo-Christian hegemonic masculinity, which was defined by ownership and control of property, including land, women, and children (Sinclair et al., 2019; Tengan, 2002). Furthermore, European and American imperialism often opposed precolonial Native practices of men being stewards of the land, women exercising self-sufficiency in marital relationships, and the family unit being extended rather than nuclear (Sinclair et al., 2019). 
	Significantly, Americans and Christians placed protective discourse on Native Hawaiians in a hierarchy of race, class, and gender to help maintain the privilege of the white oligarchy (Sinclair et al., 2019; Glenn, 2002). Also, Native men internalized this oppressive ideology as it undermined them with the socially embedded views that Native men are lazy, stupid, violent, sexually unappealing to Native women, and doomed to fail in the marketplace (Sinclair et al.,  2019; Tengan, 2008). However, the androcentrism of the missionaries and American businessmen allowed NHPI women social “invisibility” (Sinclair et al., 2019; Purdie-Vaughns & Eibach, 2008) and provided some relief from the actively discriminatory, racist practices inflicted on NHPI men (Sinclair, 2019). Furthermore, Native men are not given the same rights and advantages as white Americans regardless of whether they have Western education or actively participate in the capitalist system. Also, there were political, economic, and social forces that fortified in place to undermine the Indigenous agency and fortify the structural power of the colonizers, as evident with the introduction of land ownership, ranching, sugar cultivation, and voting requirements in Hawaii, causing Native Hawaiians to gradually lose political power and access to land that supported their independence and source of culture, traditions, and identity as a Native Hawaiian (Sinclair, et al., 2019; Tengan, 2008). These conditions have perpetuated historical trauma which fostered poor physical and behavioral health, including low self-esteem, depression, self-destructive behavior, marked propensity for violent or aggressive behavior, substance misuse and addiction, and high rates of suicide and cardiovascular disease (Sinclair et al., 2019; Sotero, 2006). However, despite this, the Native people are working with non-natives to help revive the Kanaka Maoli culture and identity through cultural education, hula dance, stories, songs, petitions against the use of sacred lands, and the sovereignty movement. Also, the Native efforts have had some success in getting attention and support as in 1993, the U.S. Congress acknowledged the 100th anniversary of the January 17, 1893 overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai'i, and offered an apology to Native Hawaiians on behalf of the United States for the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii via the UNITED STATES PUBLIC LAW 103-150 103d Congress Joint Resolution 19 Nov. 23, 1993 (U.S. Congress. 1993). Consequently, this helped reinforce a revival of the Kanaka Maoli culture and identity. 
	As of July 1, 2021, the Kanaka Maoli population has survived historical trauma with a dwindled 10.5% of the 1.4 million people in Hawai'i (U.S. Census, 2021). Hawai'i's current diverse ethnic population consists of the Kanaka Maoli hosts, Caucasian, Japanese, Filipino, Chinese, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Pacific Island peoples living harmoniously. However, the Kanaka Maoli are still the most marginalized and unrepresented. For illustration, according to the NATION OF HAWAI'I,' the Kanaka Maoli have benefitted the least and suffered the most of all populations in Hawai'i from the Territory's forced integration with the United States and the current system of economics, politics, and land administration (2022). Also, statistically, the Kanaka Maoli struggle the most economically and socially, health-wise, with suicide rate, disease, unemployment, poverty, undereducation, illiteracy, houseless-ness, substance abuse, domestic violence, etc. (NATION OF HAWAI'I, 2022). For demonstration, according to the Census Bureau in 2019, the average Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander median household income was $66,695 compared to $71,664 for white households, 14.8% of Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders compared to 9.0% of whites, were living at the poverty level, the unemployment rate for Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders was 5.9%, compared to 3.7% for whites. (CBS, 2019, as cited in OMH, 2019). 
	Then, based on OMH, educational attainment is 88.7% of Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders, alone or in combination, had high school diplomas or higher VS 93.3% for whites, 23.8 percent of Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders had a bachelor's degree or higher VS 36.9% of whites, and 7.4% of Native Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders have graduate or professional degrees VS 14.3% of whites (2019). Next, according to OMG, Native Hawaiians/ Pacific Islanders have higher rates of smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity, cancer, heart disease, unintentional injuries (accidents), stroke, diabetes, hepatitis B, HIV/AIDS, and tuberculosis due to lack of education, prevention, medicine, and medical Insurance Coverage in 2019 (2019). Despite these issues, the Kanaka Maoli continues to advocate for the betterment of their lives, self-determination, self-government, and free association with and independence from the United States (Pacheo, 2005). 
	Moreover, women activist voices have been vital to the emergence of the sovereignty discourse as they play a significant part in relinking the Natives to their cultural traditions and resurgence of the concept of pono (balance) as the kapu (sacred) foundation of a political movement (O'Connell, 2008). Astonishingly, they have survived such harsh ordeal while preserving some aspects of their culture. For illustration, the Natives' strong spiritual beliefs are embedded in their everyday life, as the elders (the kahuna and kupuna) have preserved Kanaka Maoli culture, identity, and history for the new generation via traditional and ritual beliefs, dances (hula,) songs (mele,) and stories ('olelo) to help them maintain their Native identity through their relationship to the land, people, nature, and the universe. However, these practices have had some conflict amongst the Natives. For instance, the "disenfranchised system of belief found in the Kanaka Maoli peoples, where Customary practice and Christian practice clash on certain cultural and traditional levels" (Nation of Hawai'i, 2022). These people will have to compromise and work through this issue. Also, the revival of the Native culture has fostered the frequent use of Olelo Hawai'i, as it will be the first official language of the Nation of Hawai'i, and English and Pidgin English are also official languages (Nation of Hawai'i, 2022). Therefore, despite how much the legacy of imperialism has shaped the daily lives of Natives, they have been resilient and found methods to reconnect with their culture and identity while coping and learning to navigate in the globalizing world. 
	Consequently, undoing the legacy of imperialism is impossible as it has traumatically shaped the daily lives of the Kanaka Maoli, as evident through the historic change in their culture and identity before and after U.S. colonization to the 21st Century. However, the Native of Hawai'i has survived the harsh disposition of imperialism and colonialism. Significantly, Hawai'i's circumstances are an important reminder that the legacy of imperialism has left deep scars in the globalizing world and that imperialism and colonization are a destroyer of culture and identity. The ideology and the aftershock will shape people's lives as it has for the Hawaiians and many others of the colonized. However, some people will find ways to reconnect with their culture and identity, as the Hawaiians and some displaced refugees in America have while coping and adapting to new cultures. Our ability to manage and adjust is how we survive and coexist peacefully with others in a globalizing world. Therefore, we must be inclusive, respectful, and sensitive to others.
